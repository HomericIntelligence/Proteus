# ProjectProteus — CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

ProjectProteus is the CI/CD pipeline automation hub for the HomericIntelligence ecosystem. It centralizes all pipeline logic using Dagger (TypeScript SDK), manages OCI image builds, runs test suites, promotes images via Skopeo, and orchestrates cross-repo GitHub Actions dispatch events.

- Images are built and pushed to registries managed by **AchaeanFleet**.
- Deployments are triggered in **Myrmidons** via `repository_dispatch`.
- All pipeline logic is reusable across HomericIntelligence repos via Dagger modules.

## Key Principles

- Pipelines are code: all logic lives in `dagger/src/index.ts`, not in sprawling shell scripts.
- Cross-repo coordination uses GitHub's `repository_dispatch` API — no polling.
- Image promotion (staging → production) is explicit and auditable via `scripts/promote-image.sh`.
- Environment management uses pixi; task running uses justfile. Never use Makefiles.
- New features go into new repos; do not modify existing HomericIntelligence repos.

## Pipeline Architecture

### Dagger Module (`dagger/src/index.ts`)

The `Proteus` class exposes three core pipeline functions:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `build(context, name, tag)` | Builds OCI image from Dockerfile, returns digest |
| `test(source, command)` | Runs test command inside container, returns output |
| `lint(source)` | Runs lint checks, returns output |

Dagger calls are made via `dagger call <function> --<args>` from the justfile.

### Cross-Repo Dispatch Flow

1. AchaeanFleet pushes an image and sends `repository_dispatch` (type: `image-pushed`) to ProjectProteus.
2. `cross-repo-dispatch.yml` receives the event and calls `scripts/dispatch-apply.sh`.
3. `dispatch-apply.sh` sends a `repository_dispatch` (type: `agamemnon-apply`) to Myrmidons.
4. Myrmidons runs `just apply` on the target host.

### Image Promotion Flow

```
Build (dagger call build) → Test (dagger call test) → Promote (skopeo copy) → Dispatch apply
```

This full pipeline is invoked with `just pipeline NAME`.

## Known Critical Defects

The following defects are open and **load-bearing** — agents working in
this repo should know about them before changing behaviour in the
affected areas. Always check the linked issue for the current status
before assuming the defect is unfixed.

- **Cross-repo dispatch payload contract mismatch.** `cross-repo-dispatch.yml`
  reads `client_payload.host`, but no documented upstream emitter currently
  sends that field consistently. See #15, #84.
- **Build/promote tag arithmetic broken.** The build and promote scripts
  produce incorrect tags in edge cases (multi-arch, no-tag input). See
  #2, #83.
- **Pipeline YAML configs are not consumed.** `configs/pipelines/*.yaml`
  is parsed only by `just validate`; no production code reads it.
  See #1, #82.
- **CI unit/integration "jobs" are YAML parsers, not tests.** Until #88
  / #89 / #5 land, do not rely on the green CI badge as evidence of
  Dagger function correctness.
- **GitHub Actions security gaps.** Gitleaks runs with `--exit-code 0` (#86);
  treat absence of a Gitleaks failure as inconclusive. (Trivy gate restored — #85 closed.)
- **Branch protection partial.** PRs require zero reviews (#95); no
  CODEOWNERS enforcement (#102). See `docs/branch-protection.md` for
  the target state.

Agents must not silently work around these defects; instead, link the
relevant issue from any PR that touches the affected code.

## Audit Remediation Tracking

The 2026-04-28 STRICT audit (#81) is being remediated in three waves.
See `docs/audit-2026-04-28/remediation-plan.md` for current status of
all 33 child issues, target dates, the wave dependency graph, and the
pre-batched Wave 3 PR map.

Agents picking up an audit child issue MUST:
1. Read the audit context in #81 and the relevant child issue.
2. Confirm the file target listed in `remediation-plan.md` matches the
   actual file — security-scan jobs live in `.github/workflows/_required.yml`,
   NOT in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
3. Link the child in the PR body via `Refs #81`.
4. Add a regression test under `tests/` (created in #88) for any bug fix.
5. Tick the matching checkbox in `docs/audit-2026-04-28/remediation-plan.md`.

## Development Guidelines

- All Dagger functions must be tested locally with `dagger call` before committing.
- Pipeline configs in `configs/pipelines/` must be valid YAML; `just validate` checks them.
- Scripts in `scripts/` must be executable and pass `shellcheck`.
- Keep the Dagger module typed — no `any` in TypeScript.
- Use `set -euo pipefail` in all bash scripts.
